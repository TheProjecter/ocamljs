Ocamljs is a system for compiling OCaml to Javascript. It includes a
Javascript back-end for the OCaml compiler, as well as several support
libraries, such as bindings to the browser DOM. It also works with
[http://code.google.com/p/orpc2 orpc] for RPC over HTTP to an OCaml
server, and [http://code.google.com/p/froc froc] for functional
reactive programming.

Ocamljs is written by Jake Donham, with contributions from Mike Wells
and Haoyang Wang.

===Contributing===

If you find a bug, it would be very helpful to get a test case that
produces different behavior from regular OCaml (see `test/jscomp` for
examples). Other contributions are very welcome as well. See also the
[http://groups.google.com/group/ocamljs-discuss mailing list].
