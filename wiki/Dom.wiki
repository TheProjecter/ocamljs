#summary binding to browser DOM

Ocamljs includes a partial binding to the browser DOM. There are of
course many incompatibilities between browsers. This library makes no
attempt to paper over them. See the
[http://ocamljs.googlecode.com/svn/doc/Dom.html Ocamldoc] and
[http://ocamljs.googlecode.com/svn/examples/index.html some examples].
