#summary How to install and use ocamljs

===Installing ocamljs===

  # Prerequisites: OCaml 3.10.2, findlib, ulex
  # Unpack the OCaml 3.10.2 distribution and run ./configure only, with the same options you gave when you built OCaml, then symlink it to ocamljs-0.2/ocaml
  # 'make' builds ocamljs and the associated libraries
  # 'make test' runs the test suite; you will need SpiderMonkey or other Javascript interpreter
  # 'make install' installs ocamljs and the associated libraries
  # 'make examples' builds all the examples

===Using ocamljs===

The command 'ocamljs' may be used just like ocamlc or ocamlopt. It
generates .cmjs/.cmjsa files instead of .cmo/.cma. A linked file (.js)
consists of Javascript source, which may be run through a standalone
Javascript interpreter, or embedded in a web page or Firefox
extension. See the examples for details.

See tools/myocambuild.ml for some useful ocamlbuild rules.

There is also [Findlib findlib support].
