===Using ocamljs===

The command 'ocamljs' may be used just like ocamlc or ocamlopt. It
generates .cmjs/.cmjsa files instead of .cmo/.cma. A linked file (.js)
consists of Javascript source, which may be run through a standalone
Javascript interpreter, or embedded in a web page or Firefox
extension. See the examples for details.

See tools/myocambuild.ml for some useful ocamlbuild rules.

There is also [Findlib findlib support].
