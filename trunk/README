This is ocamljs, a Javascript back-end for ocamlc, version 0.1.

Installation:

  0. Install OCaml 3.10.0.
  1. Unpack the OCaml 3.10.0 distribution and run ./configure only,
     with the same options you gave when you built OCaml, then symlink
     it to ocamljs-0.1/ocaml.
  2. 'make' builds ocamljs and the standard library
  3. 'make test' runs the test suite; you will need SpiderMonkey or
     other Javascript interpreter
  4. 'make install' installs ocamljs and the standard library

What works (partial list):

  The core of OCaml including the module system
  Much of the standard library (including Printf)
  Tail-recursion
  Generated code runs in Firefox/SpiderMonkey

  We are using ocamljs for a production Firefox extension at Skydeck,
  but implementation has been on an as-needed basis.

What doesn't work or is unknown to work (partial list):

  The object system
  Floats need some work
  Some of the standard library
  Untested in other Javascript implementations

Contributing:

  If you find a bug, it would be very helpful to get a test case that
  produces different behavior from regular OCaml. For now I'd like to
  shoot for getting as much of OCaml and the standard library working
  as possible, then focus on performance.

Future plans:

  Improve code generation. CPS/closure-convert to first-order rep? Threads?
  Clean up and release Firefox library
  Something like Google Web Toolkit
  Port the toplevel to ocamljs for a 'try OCaml' page
