  cleaner heap rep (arrays, tag in last elem)

  more stdlib work--other things to implement natively?
  clean up printf
  check float format (e.g. float_of_string) JS vs. OCaml
  make Pervasives.^ do native string concat

  check .js linking with libraries

  can we do better interoperating with exceptions? would be nice to be
  able to declare, catch, and match exceptions from JS libs.

  can we avoid Ocamljs.jsfun wrapper? maybe make trampolining / partial
  application the responsibility of the callee instead of the caller?
